# GDriveManifest
## Step by Step:

1. Open a new Google Sheet document from the Google account for which you want a Google Drive directory listing.
2. In the toolbar for the new Google Sheet, go to Tools -> Script editor
3. A code editor will open. Replace any sample code in the editor with the code included in the GDriveManifest.js file.
4. Edit code by replacing *target-folder* with the name of folder for which you desire a manifest.
5. Save the inserted code; application will ask for a project file name.
6. Run script by clicking on the right-pointing triangle in the button bar.
7. 'Authorization required' pop up will appear; grant authorization.
8. A listing of the files in the specified folder, along with URLs for those files, will then appear in your root My Drive as a Google Sheet named 'manifest for folder *target-folder*'
